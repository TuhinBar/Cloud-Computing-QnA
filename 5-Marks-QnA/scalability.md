# Q. Explain scalability by means of an example.

## *What is scalability?*

- Cloud scalability is all about adding or reducing IT resources to meet changes in demand. It’s the ability of a system to accommodate larger or smaller loads.

- Businesses can scale up or down (vertically) and out or in (horizontally). For example, scaling up makes hardware stronger; scaling out adds additional nodes. More on these later.

- If your business requires more data storage capacity or processing power, you want a system that can scale easily and quickly.

- Cloud computing solutions can do just that, contributing to why the market has grown so much in recent years. By using existing cloud infrastructure, third-party cloud vendors can scale with minimal disruption.

- A scalability in cloud computing example? We helped healthcare startup Nodus Medical scale their medical platform in a secure and robust way. Mitigating to the cloud facilitated their ability to scale.

- By contrast, let’s consider a company with on-premises physical infrastructure. A business like that will find scaling time-consuming and expensive.

## *When to use cloud scalability?*
- Scalable business models are nothing new: they allow businesses to meet changing needs. Cloud scalability applies to the IT side of your business. By making the most of cloud scalability, your business stays competitive.

- Scalability drives migration to the cloud. When a business grows and needs more resources, cloud scalability enables a rapid response. It also offers a cost-effective solution.

## *How to achieve cloud scalability?*
- Virtualization is what makes cloud scalability possible.

- There are limits to the resources and performance of physical machines. On the flip side, virtual machines are flexible and easily scaled. It’s possible to move virtual machines to a different server or host them on multiple servers. Upgrades to larger virtual machines are possible, too.

- What’s more, with technological advances such as better internet speeds and 5G, virtual machines are more productive than ever.

- How your business achieves scalability depends on your cloud model. For example, third-party public cloud vendors have access to significant amounts of resources. That allows for speedy and cost-friendly scaling. Equally, private clouds and hybrid clouds offer customized, scalable solutions.

### There are usually two ways to scale a cloud-based solution:

- Contact your cloud provider and request it.
- Add the required resources yourself via an online portal.
Some solutions can be auto-scaled. That means setting them to scale up or down based on the conditions you input. For example, you may set a rule to automatically scale up when you’re running out of storage space. Cloud solutions such as Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform (GCO) offer that.
