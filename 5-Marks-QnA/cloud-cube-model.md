# Q.  Discuss the details with diagram(s) the cloud cube model.

## *What is Cloud Cube Model?*
Cloud Cube model, helps to categorize the cloud network based on the four-dimensional factor. Their main focus is to protect and secure the cloud network. This cloud cube model helps to select cloud formation for secure collaboration.

This model helps IT managers, organizations, and business leaders by providing the secure and protected network.

Security is an important concern for cloud customers and most of the cloud providers understand it. The customer should also keep in mind, the selected cloud formation meets the regulatory and location requirements.

They should also keep in mind that if cloud providers stop providing the services, where else they can move. There are three service models, which include:

- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

## *In addition, there are four deployment models such as:*

- Public Cloud
- Private Cloud
- Community Cloud
- Hybrid Cloud
These models are very flexible Agile and responsible. They are user-friendly and provide many benefits to the customers.

## *How to Secure Data in the Cloud Cube Model?*
There are some steps and points to keep in mind before securing your data in a cloud cube model:

### Step 1
The classification of the data, the customer should know what rules must be applied to protect it.


### Step 2
It should be ensured, the data exist only in specific trust levels.

### Step 3
It should check that what regulatory compliance and restrictions are applicable. For example, the data should stay in a particular boundary and whether it has to stay in the safe harbour or not.

After the data is classified and is ready to put in the required zone, the assigned person is in a position to decide the following factors-

- The data and processes, which are to be moved in the cloud.
- At what level the user wants to operate in the cloud. It can be infrastructure, platform, software, or platform as a service.
- The cloud formations, which are mostly compatible as per the requirement.
- The level of operation in the cloud can be different as per the requirement.
- Below is the chart which shows the Cloud layers, where the cloud operates.

After that, there are forms of cloud and the user can store the data which is mostly compatible with the company.

## *Dimensions of Cloud Cube Model*
Cloud Cube model has four dimensions to categorized cloud formations:

- Internal/External
- Proprietary/Open
- De-Perimeterized/Perimeterized
- Insourced/Outsourced Dimension

### *i. Internal/External*
The most basic cloud form is the external and internal cloud form. The external or internal dimension defines the physical location of the data. It acknowledges us whether the data exists inside or outside of your organization’s boundary.

Here, the data which is stored using a private cloud deployment will be considered internal and data outside the cloud will be considered external.

### *ii. Proprietary/Open*
The second type of cloud formation is proprietary and open. The proprietary or open dimension states about the state of ownership of the cloud technology and interfaces. It also tells the degree of interoperability, while enabling data transportability between the system and other cloud forms.

The proprietary dimension means, that the organization providing the service is securing and protecting the data under their ownership.

The open dimension is using a technology in which there are more suppliers. Moreover, the user is not constrained in being able to share the data and collaborate with selected partners using the open technology.

### *iii. De-Perimeterized/Perimeterized*
The third type of cloud formation is De-perimeterized and Perimeterized. To reach this form, the user needs collaboration oriented architecture and Jericho forum commandments.

The Perimeterised and De-perimeterized dimension tells us whether you are operating inside your traditional it mindset or outside it.

Perimeterized dimension means, continuing to operate within the traditional it boundary, orphan signaled by network firewalls.

With the help of VPN and operation of the virtual server in your own IP domain, the user can extend the organizations perimeter into external Cloud Computing domain. This means that the user is making use of the own services to control access.

De-perimeterized dimension means the system perimeter is architected on the principles outlined in the Jericho forums commandments. In De-perimeterized dimension, the data will be encapsulated with metadata and mechanisms, which will further help to protect the data and limit the inappropriate usage.

### *iv. Insourced/Outsourced*
The Insourced and outsourced dimensions have two states in each of the eight cloud forms. In the outsourced dimension the services provided by the third party, whereas in the insourced dimension the services provided by the own staff under the control.

In this few organizations that are traditional bandwidth software or hardware, providers will run fluently on becoming cloud service providers.

The organizations which are seeking to procedure cloud services must have the ability to set legally binding collaboration agreement. In this, an organization should ensure that data is deleted from the service provider’s Infrastructure.
