# Q.  Mention resources provided by IaaS. Explain various reasons for data center migration to cloud. (MAKAUT 2019)

## Part 1

### *Infrastructure as a Service | IaaS*
Iaas is also known as Hardware as a Service (HaaS). It is one of the layers of the cloud computing platform. It allows customers to outsource their IT infrastructures such as servers, networking, processing, storage, virtual machines, and other resources. Customers access these resources on the Internet using a pay-as-per use model.

In traditional hosting services, IT infrastructure was rented out for a specific period of time, with pre-determined hardware configuration. The client paid for the configuration and time, regardless of the actual use. With the help of the IaaS cloud computing platform layer, clients can dynamically scale the configuration to meet changing requirements and are billed only for the services actually used.

IaaS cloud computing platform layer eliminates the need for every organization to maintain the IT infrastructure.

- IaaS is offered in three models: public, private, and hybrid cloud. The private cloud implies that the infrastructure resides at the customer-premise. In the case of public cloud, it is located at the cloud computing platform vendor's data center, and the hybrid cloud is a combination of the two in which the customer selects the best of both public cloud or private cloud.

### *IaaS provider provides the following services*

- Compute: Computing as a Service includes virtual central processing units and virtual main memory for the Vms that is provisioned to the end- users.
- Storage: IaaS provider provides back-end storage for storing files.
- Network: Network as a Service (NaaS) provides networking components such as routers, switches, and bridges for the Vms.
- Load balancers: It provides load balancing capability at the infrastructure layer.

### Reduce Capital Expenditure

Reducing capital expenditure is one of the key drivers
behind data center cloud migration. By employing
cloud-based data centers, organizations only pay for the
resources they consume and save time and money by
removing the need to buy, install, configure, and maintain
an expensive on-premises infrastructure.

### Lower Ongoing Costs

The cloud offers substantial economies of scale and
efficiency improvements, which allow cloud platform
providers to continually lower prices. By taking
advantage of multiple pricing models, including hourly
pricing, organizations can optimize costs for both
variable and stable workloads

### Improve Scalability & Elasticity

The cloud allows organizations to provision only the
amount of resources they need and easily scale up or
down as required. This enables organizations to ensure
expensive resources are not sitting idle and eliminates the
need to deal with limited capacity due to on-premises
hardware restrictions.

### Improve Time-to-Market

In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources
are very easy to commission, significantly reducing the
time it takes organizations to make those resources
available to developers from weeks to just minutes. This
lowers the cost and time it takes to experiment and
develop, resulting in dramatic increase in
organizational agility and time-to-market.
In addition, the ease with which applications can be
deployed in multiple regions around the world means
organizations can provide a lower latency and better
experience for customers at a minimal cost and
maximum speed.

### Focus on Core Business

With the reduced need for an organization’s IT
department to be involved with the heavy lifting of
racking, stacking, and powering servers, resources are
freed up to focus on the organization’s own
customers. Concentrating on the projects that
differentiate an organization’s core business, rather
than the infrastructure, substantially improves
products, services, delivery, and ultimately the ability
to compete.

### Security and Compliance

Despite the common misconception that a cloud
environment is less secure, strategic goals in relation to
security and compliance are often key drivers to migrate
data centers to the cloud. The major cloud platform
providers invest heavily in security and compliance and are
more often than not able to provide a better security
profile than what the biggest and most conservative
organizations can deliver internally.
