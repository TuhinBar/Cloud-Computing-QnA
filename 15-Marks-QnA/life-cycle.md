# Q. Cloud Computing life cycle. NIST model of cloud computing (MAKAUT 2018)

## *Life Cycle Of Cloud Computing Solution*
To create such a cloud platform it takes a long number of steps and dedicated time. Let’s now look at the steps involved or the lifecycle of cloud computing solutions.

### *Step 1: Define the Purpose*
The first and foremost step is to define the purpose for which you want to create a cloud. For this, you have first to understand your business requirement and what type of application you want to run on the cloud. After this, you have to decide whether you want your cloud to be public, private, or hybrid.

### *Step 2: Define the Hardware*
Deciding what type of hardware you will need is the most thought after the process. One needs to be very precise in making the decision. For this, you will have to choose the compute service that will provide the right support when you resize your compute capacity to maintain your application running.

### *Step 3: Define the Storage*
Every application needs a good amount of storage where it’s data can be stored safely. For any application storage type that should be chosen carefully for this one should choose the storage service where they can back up and archive their data over the internet.

### *Step 4: Define the Network*
Networking is the key that will deliver your data to the end-users. So, the network must be configured sincerely and should be flawless so that intruders can not break into the network. One should define the network that securely delivers data, videos, and applications with low latency and high transfer speed. 

### *Step 5: Define the Security*
Security is a key aspect of any application. Set up your security service which enables services for user authentication or limiting access to a certain set of users on your resources. 

### *Step 6: Define the Management Process and Tools*
The developer should have complete control over there resource and to configure these you should define some management tools which monitor your cloud environment, resources used, and the customer application running on it.

### *Step 7: Testing the Process*
Testing is yet another important thing in the life cycle of deploying any application. All the faults can figure out only through the testing process involved in it. During testing, you should verify your application using various developer tools where you build, test, and deploy your code quickly.

### *Step 8: Analytics*
Finally, analyze and visualize data using analytics service where you can start querying data instantly and get results then and there only.  Once analyzing is done complete, your application becomes ready you deploying.

### Advantages
- Cost Saving- It helps you to save substantial capital costs as it does not need any physical hardware investments.
- High Speed- Cloud computing allows you to deploy your service quickly in fewer clicks.
- Backup and restore of data- Back up and restore of data is easy in cloud computing.
- Reliability- It is highly reliable to use cloud computing solutions.
### Disadvantages 
- Performance can vary- Its performance depends on the speed and quality of the internet
- Downtime- Cloud Computing Solutions has a great span of downtime.

## Part 2 (NIST MODEL)

### NIST’s Cloud Computing Definition and Model
NIST’s cloud model (definition) is composed of:

- Five essential characteristics
- Three service models
- Four deployment models
- NIST’s Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

The five essential characteristics of a cloud service create the cloud computing infrastructure. It includes a physical layer of hardware resources and an abstraction layer which consists of the software deployed across the physical layer. These attributes are:

### On-Demand Self-Service
Self-service means that the cloud user can acquire the service on their own without having to go through an IT department, call center, or other middle man.

### To support self-service:

- The cloud provider must provide an automated interface, such as a web portal or mobile app.

- The user should be able to request the interface at any time.

- The user should also be able to cancel the cloud service at any time.

### Broad Network Access
The cloud service must be broadly available over the communication network, and users should be able to access it from any location and internet-enabled device.

### Resource Pooling
Multiple customers share the cloud service resources in a multi-tenancy model. This model raises privacy and security concerns, so users must protect their cloud data and assets by taking all necessary security precautions.

### Rapid Elasticity
Elasticity refers to the flexibility of the cloud service to scale up or down automatically to meet the user’s needs. That allows the user to access the right level and kind of resources, including processing power, memory, network bandwidth, and storage, to accommodate the user’s varying workloads.

### Measured Service
A measured cloud service provides a metering capability that underpins the provider’s pay-as-you-go pricing model. This model provides users with greater transparency and control over their cloud costs.

### *NIST’s Three Cloud Service Models*
NIST identifies three cloud service models:

### Software-as-a-Service or SaaS
In the SaaS model, the cloud provider manages the underlying software and IT infrastructure. Users access the SaaS offering via a web browser. Local installation is not required, and organizations don’t have to worry about managing data centers, IT operations, or maintenance.

Some popular examples of SaaS applications include:

- AWS
- Salesforce
- Microsoft Office 365
- Google applications (G-Suite), including Gmail
- Dropbox
- SAP
- Adobe Creative Cloud

### Platform-as-a-Service or PaaS
PaaS provides a powerful development platform with programming languages, web-based APIs, and processes that allow software developers to create cloud-based applications. The PaaS provider fully manages the underlying infrastructure. Moreover, the platform automatically configures infrastructure resources across user-created environments.

Some popular PaaS providers include:

- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Oracle Cloud Platform (OCP)
- Google App Engine
- Microsoft Azure
- Red Hat OpenShift PaaS
- IBM Cloud Platform
- SAP Cloud Platform

### Infrastructure-as-a-Service or IaaS
Users can rent the cloud IT infrastructure, such as servers, networking, and storage, from an IaaS provider on a pay-as-you-go basis, so the user doesn’t have to incur the cost of on-premises installation or maintenance.

- Examples of popular IaaS providers include:

- AWS EC2
- Google Compute Engine
- Linode
- DigitalOcean
- Azure Virtual Machines
- IBM Cloud Private
- NIST’s Four Cloud Deployment Models

The final part of the NIST cloud computing definition includes four cloud deployment models, representing four types of cloud environments. Users can choose the model with features and capabilities that are best suited for their needs.

### Private Cloud
A private cloud is a single-tenant environment provisioned for use by a single organization.

Security is one of the most significant benefits of a private cloud, which means that the company’s data cannot be accessed by anyone other than its authorized users. That’s why the private cloud is a good choice for organizations whose data or assets are too valuable or sensitive to put on a public cloud and for firms aiming for HIPAA or PCI DSS compliance.

Some key private cloud providers are:

- VMWare
- Dell
- Oracle
- IBM
- Microsoft
- Cisco
- AWS

### Public Cloud
In this multi-tenant deployment model, the cloud is owned by the cloud service provider. The underlying resources are shared by multiple customers who pay for the resources they use on a pay-as-you-use basis.

The provider owns, controls, and protects the security requirements of data among different customers. The provider is also responsible for administration, maintenance, troubleshooting, capacity planning, and data backups.

As of third-quarter 2021, the top three public cloud providers are AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, which occupy 32, 21, and 8 percent of market share, respectively. Other up-and-coming public cloud providers include:

- Alibaba Cloud
- IBM
- DigitalOcean
- Dell
- Adobe

### Hybrid Cloud
In a hybrid cloud, the cloud infrastructure comprises two or more distinct public or private clouds, bound together by technology that supports data and application portability. It provides greater flexibility, portability, and scalability than the other deployment models.

Examples of hybrid cloud providers include:

- AWS VPC
- EMC
- BMC
- F5
- NetApp

### Community Cloud
A community cloud is used by a community of users from organizations with shared concerns. This multi-tenant platform allows multiple companies or special interest user groups to collaborate securely on projects or research.

Community clouds are common in government, healthcare, and education; for use cases such as:

- Customer service
- Partner relationship management
- Channel sales
- Dealer contract renewals
- Employee engagement
- Collaboration and business decision-making

### The Benefits of NIST’s Cloud Computing Definition
NIST’s cloud computing definition allows organizations to compare various cloud services and deployment strategies. A deep understanding of this definition can help organizations better appreciate the benefits of this technology, implement NIST compliance best practices, and guide decision-makers to make optimal cloud investment decisions
